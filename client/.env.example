# Render Keep-Alive Configuration

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the client directory:

```env
VITE_SERVER_URL=https://your-backend-url.onrender.com
```

Replace `your-backend-url` with your actual Render backend URL after deployment.

## Testing Locally

To test the keep-alive mechanism locally:

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open browser console - you should see:
   - `🚀 Keep-alive started - pinging every 12 minutes`
   - After 12 minutes: `✅ Keep-alive ping successful`

## External Monitoring (Recommended)

For true 24/7 uptime, use an external service:

### UptimeRobot Setup
1. Go to uptimerobot.com
2. Add New Monitor
3. Monitor Type: HTTP(s)
4. Friendly Name: Polling System Keep-Alive
5. URL: `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/health`
6. Monitoring Interval: 5 minutes
7. Save

This ensures your server stays active even when no users are online.
